# Caesar Cipher Python Project

This is a Python project that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt his military messages. It is a form of symmetric encryption, meaning that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

The encryption process involves "shifting" each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift value is 3, then 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', 'C' becomes 'F', and so on. Decryption is performed by shifting the letters in the opposite direction.

## Usage

To use this Python program, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is compatible with Python 3.

3. Open a terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the project's directory.

4. Run the program using the following command:
   python caesar_cipher.py
5. The program will prompt you to choose between encryption and decryption and ask for the necessary inputs (text and shift value).

6. The output will be displayed on the terminal.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine.

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
Alternatively, you can download the source code as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository.

## How it works

The Caesar Cipher algorithm works as follows:

1. The program takes the input text (plaintext) and a shift value as input from the user.

2. For encryption, each letter in the plaintext is shifted forward in the alphabet by the given shift value.

3. For decryption, each letter in the ciphertext (encrypted text) is shifted backward in the alphabet by the given shift value to reveal the original plaintext.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how the Caesar Cipher works:

- Encryption with a shift value of 3:

  - Plaintext: "HELLO"
  - Ciphertext: "KHOOR"

- Decryption with a shift value of 3:

  - Ciphertext: "KHOOR"
  - Plaintext: "HELLO"
